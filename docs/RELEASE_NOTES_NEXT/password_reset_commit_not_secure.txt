The previous log protect redaction instructions missed a method used
by the patron initiated password reset system.  In order to fill this
gap, you need to find the <log_protect> portion of your
opensrf_core.xml file and add the following line:

      <match_string>open-ils.actor.patron.password_reset.commit</match_string>

You should see a number of similar lines already there in between
<log_protect> and </log_protect>.
