Action Trigger Event Repeatability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Action Trigger Event Definitions have a new field, "Event Repeatability
Delay". This feature allows events to be repeated after the designated
delay interval. An example of this is sending a notification email when a
patron's library card expires. If the library extends the expiration date
on that card, we then need a way to send another notification email when
that same card expires again. Before, the Action Trigger processor only
created a new event if the event definition for that target had never
been run before. But now it allows repeating of the event after the delay
interval, if present.
