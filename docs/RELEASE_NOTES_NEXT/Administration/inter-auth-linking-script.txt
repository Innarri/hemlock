Inter-authority linking script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adds a script called authority_authority_linker.pl in support-scripts that,
when run, will link authority reference headings to authority records that 
containt the same main entry using a subfield 0. This causes triggers to fill
up the authority-authority linking table and allows more information to appear
in the bib/authority browse when a displayed heading comes from an authority
record that has linked _See Also_ refererences.
