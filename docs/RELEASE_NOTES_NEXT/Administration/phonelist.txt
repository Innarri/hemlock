Phonelist.pm Module
===================

PhoneList.pm is a mod_perl module for Apache that works with Evergreen
to generate callings lists for patron holds. It outputs a csv file
that can be fed into an auto-dialer script to call patrons with little
or no staff intervention.  It is accessed and configured via a special
URL and passing any parameters as a ``Query String'' on the URL.  The
parameters are listed in the table below.

.Parameters for the phonelist program:
|=====================================
| user |  Your Evergreen login. Typically your library's circ account. If you leave this off, you will be prompted to login.
| passwd | The password for your Evergreen login. If you leave this off you will be prompted to login.
| ws_ou | The ID of the system or branch you want to generate the list for (optional). If your account does not have the appropriate permissions for the location whose ID number you have entered, you will get an error.
| skipemail | If present, skip patrons with email notification (optional).
| addcount | Add a count of items on hold (optional). Only makes sense for holds.
| overdue | Makes a list of patrons with overdues instead of holds. If an additional, numeric parameter is supplied, it will be used as the number of days overdue. If no such extra parameter is supplied, then the default of 14 days is used.
|=====================================

The URL is

`https://your.evergreen-server.tld/phonelist`

A couple of examples follow:

`https://your.evergreen-server.tld/phonelist?user=circuser&passwd=password&skipemail

The above example would sign in as user circuser with password of
``password'' and get a list of patrons with holds to call who do not
have email notification turned on. It would run at whatever branch is
normally associated with circuser.

`https://your.evergreen-server.tld/phonelist?skipemail`

The above example would do more or less the same, but you would be
prompted by your browser for the user name and password.

If your browser or download script support it, you may also use
conventional HTTP authentication parameters.

`https://user:password@your.evergreen-server.tld/phonelist?overdue&ws_ou=2`

The above logs in as ``user'' with ``password'' and runs overdues for location ID 2.
