New Updates Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Source code for tools to generate the staff clients updates tools were
added to Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/external/libmar.  These tools
replace the downloadable tools from Mozilla.org that were previously
used to generate the staff client updates files.

They come with their own configuration script and are condfigured
automatically as a subpackage when you configure Evergreen for
installation.  They are also built and ready for use when you make
Evergreen during the installation or upgrade process.

The make_updates.sh script that is run when you tell Evergreen to make
the staff client updates has been modified to use the new tools.

These tools introduce a dependency on libbz2.  This is often only
available when installing the libbz2-dev or libbz2-devel packages.
Thus this branch introduces a new depency on the development packages
for libbz2 in Evergreen.

Nothing in the user facing behavior of building updates changes with
these tools.  They are drop-in replacements for the previous tools and
other than the new dependency on libbz2, you don't even need to know
that they are there.

These tools were added to Evergreen to be an aid in portability to
operating systems other than Linux.  They also remove a dependency on
a third-party tool, that is typically downloaded as a binary.
