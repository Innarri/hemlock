Calculated Proximity Adjustments
================================

Allows customization to the way that Evergreen measures the distance between
org units for the purposes of 1) determining what copy at what org unit is best
suited for targeting a title-level hold, and 2) determining what hold is best
suited for fulfillment by a copy-in-hand at capture (checkin) time.  The
customization is based on a table 'actor.org_unit_proximity_adjustment', with
certain matching criteria that the system compares to properties of the holds
and copies in question.
