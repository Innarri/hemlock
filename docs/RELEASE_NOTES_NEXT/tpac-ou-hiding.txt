TPAC Org Unit Hiding
====================

Adds support for the opac.org_unit_hiding.depth org unit setting to
TPAC, which makes out-of-scope org units disappear (except when
explicitly requested).

Org unit hiding is based on the physical_loc (Physical Location) param /
cookie, which is the closest analog to 'ol' (original location), from
which it was based in the JSPAC.
