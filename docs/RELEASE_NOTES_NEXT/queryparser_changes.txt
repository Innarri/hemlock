Search Changes
==============
A number of changes have been made to search to allow more control and improve
performance. These changes and their associated configurations are global to
the entire system and can not be configured on a per-library basis.

Amongst other things the new search code fixes:

* Inability to use statuses and locations as part of a larger query
* Invalid queries being generated from advanced searches
* Some timeouts from backend code taking too long to preform a search
* Some filters being one-use only
* Negations not working properly where multiple indexes are involved

Improvements include:

* Exact matches on input should be more likely to float to the top of results
* Non-English stemming can be used, alongside or instead of English stemming
* Entered search terms can be found across multiple indexes

Default configuration is geared towards English but is easily changed. In a
production environment changes will likely require re-indexing, however.

The upgrade script could be pre-tweaked to install desired configuration before
it builds and/or re-builds many of the indexes.
