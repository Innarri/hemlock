Serial Alerts At Receive Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the Serial Control View, you can now flag a note as an "alert" to
make it more visible on the receiving interface. This flag is available
on subscription, distribution and item notes. The new "Alerts" button
on the Items tab displays the number of alert notes that are available
for the selected items, and clicking this button opens a window which
displays all applicable alert notes, sorted by type. Notes can also be
edited or deleted from this window.
