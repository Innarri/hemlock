TPAC: Google Books preview
==========================

Setting `ctx.google_books_preview` to `1` in the TPAC `config.tt2`
configuration file will cause the TPAC to check to see, as part of the record
details view, if Google Books has an online preview available. If it does,
then a preview button will be displayed in the book cover image location.
If the user then clicks the preview button, the preview will load below the
title of the book in the record details page.

By default, this functionality is disabled to protect the privacy of users
who might not want to share their browsing behaviour with Google.
