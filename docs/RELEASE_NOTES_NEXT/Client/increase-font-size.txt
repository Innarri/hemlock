Adjustable font size in the staff client catalog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When using the staff client, the font size in the catalog can now be
increased/decreased by using the CTRL key with + (to increase), with - (to
decrease), and with 0 (to restore default font size). Font sizes can persist
via a setting in user preferences.
