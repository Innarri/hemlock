New Feature: Customize Items Out Display for Lost, etc.
=======================================================

Items which are LOST, LONGOVERDUE, or CLAIMSRETURNED may now be displayed 
in the top/main list of circulations instead of the bottom list in the
staff client patron Items Out interface.  Similarly, such items can be 
removed from the display once the items are checked in even if the 
transaction is still open (fines are owed, etc.).

Apart from organization, this has two additional effects:

 * If all 3 types are hidden once checked in, the interface becomes a true
   items out interface, instead of a combination of items out and 
   special circumstance checked-in circs.
 * If, in addition, all types are configured to be displayed in the top
   list, the bottom list is hidden from the UI (since nothing would display
   there), which creates more screen space for the main items out list.

New Org Unit Settings
---------------------

 * ui.circ.items_out.longoverdue    | Items Out Long-Overdue display setting
 * ui.circ.items_out.lost           | Items Out Lost display setting
 * ui.circ.items_out.claimsreturned | Items Out Claims Returned display setting

The value for each is a numeric code, describing which list the circulation
should appear while checked out and whether the circulation should continue 
to appear in the bottom list, when checked in, regardless of the state of
the transaction.

Value Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~

 * 1 = top list, then bottom list 
 * 2 = bottom list, then bottom list
 * 5 = top list, then do not display
 * 6 = bottom list, then do not display

Hint: to hide the bottom list entirely, set the value for all three settings 
to '5'.
