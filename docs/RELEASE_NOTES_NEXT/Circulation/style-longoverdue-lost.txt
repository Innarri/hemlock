Different Styles for Long Overdue Lost Items in Billing Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a Lost or Long Overdue circulation, which has not yet been returned, 
appears in the patron's list of billed trasactions, style them differently
from other not-yet-returned items.

The interface will also display a helpful message to staff indicating what 
colors map to what types of circulations.

The default colors are maroon for Lost items and orange for Long Overdue items.

To change the colors, modify circ.css. To change the language for the hint,
modify lang.dtd.
