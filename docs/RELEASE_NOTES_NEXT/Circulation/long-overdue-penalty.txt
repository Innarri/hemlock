New Feature: Long-Overdue Patron Standing Penalty
=================================================

This is the long-overdue version of the existing PATRON_EXCEEDS_LOST_COUNT 
standing penalty.  When a patron exceeds the configured threshold for open
long-overdue (i.e. non-zero balance) circulations, the penalty is applied. 
When the number once again goes below the threshold, the penalty is removed.

The penalty name is PATRON_EXCEEDS_LONGOVERDUE_COUNT / "Patron Exceeds Max 
Long-Overdue Threshold"
