Patron blocking by lost items and include lost as items out
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature has two main parts, both of which are to improve the staff's
ability to assist patrons in regards to lost items.

* Patron blocking by lost items.  This will add a group penalty threshold
that will alert staff when a patron has too many lost items.  This
setting is modified through the Group Penalty Thresholds page.

* Include lost items as items out.  Through a new library setting,
'Include Lost circulations in lump sum tallies in Patron Display',
the staff have the ability to determine if lost items will be included
in items out.
