Per-Hold Behind Desk Setting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The value for behind-the-desk pickup is now stored directly on each
hold request.  This allows the system to better track the true location 
of captured hold items in cases where the patron setting has changed since
hold capture.

For these features to be accessible, the "Behind Desk Pickup Supported" 
(circ.holds.behind_desk_pickup_supported) org unit setting must be set 
to true.

Staff Client
++++++++++++

In addition to the counts of ready for pickup and available holds, the
staff client now also displays the number of behind the desk holds ready 
for pickup at the staff's working location.  If no items are held behind
the desk, this information does not display, in particular, because this 
information is useless if behind the desk holds are not supported at the 
staff's working location.

TPAC Changes
++++++++++++

The system also allows patrons to set their own behind-the-desk 
pickup preferences in the TPAC settings interface.  To activate this
feature, admins need to set the Opac Visible flag to "true" for the 
"Hold is behind Circ Desk" (circ.holds_behind_desk) user setting and
"Behind Desk Pickup Supported" must be set to true for the patron's
home library.
