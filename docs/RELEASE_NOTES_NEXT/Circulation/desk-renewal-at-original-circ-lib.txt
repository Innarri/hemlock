Setting for Desk Renewal to use original circulating library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new global flag option has been added to allow the circulating library of 
a desk renewal (aka a renewal using the staff client) to reuse the original 
circulation library for circ rule behaviors rather than using the workstation.
This new setting is similar to existing options to use the originating 
circulation library in OPAC renewals.
