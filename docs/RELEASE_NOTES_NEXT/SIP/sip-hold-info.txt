Return Hold ID to SIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there is a hold on a copy, Evergreen will now return to SIP a hold id to 
indicate that the copy has been captured for a hold. One possible use case for
this feature is a scenario where a delivery vendor may be sorting copies needed
for holds into a different bin from copies returning to their home library. The
presence of the hold ID indicates that the copy has been captured for a hold.
It also could use for an Automated Materials Handling (AMH) System to indicate
that the copy is needed to fill a hold.
