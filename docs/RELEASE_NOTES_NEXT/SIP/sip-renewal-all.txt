Support for SIP "Renew All" messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Evergreen now supports SIP "Renew All" functionality, AKA SIP message pair
65/66. When a 65 message is received, the SIP code collcets all open 
transactions for the user and renews them all. The set of successful and
failed renewals is returned to the caller via the SIP BM and BN fields.
