Server Add-ons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This adds a "Server Add-ons" menu entry under Admin -> Workstation
Administration in the staff client.  Choosing this allows you to edit or set a
list of identifiers that correspond to JSAN-style modules found in
/server/addons/, and is meant mainly for activating 3rd party modules within the
staff client on a per-workstation basis.  You need the
ADMIN_SERVER_ADDON_FOR_WORKSTATION permission to use it.

Configuration options for activated add-ons may also show up in this interface.
