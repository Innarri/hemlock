Linked library names in copy details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A patron may find one or more available copies of an item that they want to
retrieve, but may not be familiar with the location, hours of operation, or
contact information for each branch of their local library system. To enable
the patron to quickly access information about a given library branch, the TPAC
and KPAC can link the name of the branch in the copy details display to a URL
associated with that branch.

To set the URL for a given branch, use the *Local Administration -> Library
Settings Editor* and edit the *Library Information URL* setting for that
branch. Any branches that do not have a library information URL setting display
as normal text.
