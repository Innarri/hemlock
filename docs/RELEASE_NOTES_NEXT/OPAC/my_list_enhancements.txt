My List Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The _My Lists_ feature has the following enhancements:

* Improvement on current navigation for _My Lists_ by displaying a page number
and allowing for navigation by page number;
* Addition of pagination for items in a list;
* Addition of _My Lists Preferences_ tab in _Account Preferences_ where users
can identify the number of lists and the number of list items that should 
display in each page;
* A prompt now displays when users select the _Delete List_ button confirming
that they really want to delete the list.
