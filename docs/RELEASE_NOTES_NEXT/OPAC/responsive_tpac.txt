Responsive catalog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The design of the web catalog is more responsive, optimizing its display for 
mobile devices. Users will see the following changes to the catalog's display
when viewing it on a device with a small screen:

- Elements on the basic search page were resized to fit better on the screen. 

- Results display cleanly on the search results page. Facets do not display by
default, but a _Refine these results_ button is available to retrieve facets.
Links to _Place hold_ or _Add to my list_ display prominently beneath holdings
information.

- Search boxes and filters wrap neatly on the advanced search page.

- The search bar was removed from the login and My Account pages to free up
real estate for more relevant information.

- Navigational tabs were replaced with dropdown menus in several My Account
screens.
