Authority-enhanced bibliographic browse
---------------------------------------

The Evergreen OPAC includes functionality for browsing by bibliographic terms,
and where those terms are controlled by authority records, for linking directly
to the records that use other authority controlled terms that are appropriately
linked to the browse-exposed term.  In this way, one can browse authors for
"King, Stephen" and, when appropriate and correct cataloging has been performed,
be presented with a browse link within the author browse list to that brings the
user to a "Bachman, Richard" entry, assuming visible bibliographic records are
indeed attached to both records. Likewise, when browsing for "Bachman,
Richard", users will be presented with a browse link leading to the "King,
Stephen" browse location.

Additionally, any unused but inter-authority-linked terms will appear in the
browse list if the linked heading is in use by bibliographic records.  In this
way, browsing for "Bachman, Richard" will lead the user the "King, Stephen" even
if no bibliographic records make use of the "Bachman, Richard" heading.

Linked authority records will not be exposed of neither is in use by visible
bibliographic records.  This means that the feature will not lead to dead-end
searches, but also means that this is not a complete authority browsing tool
acceptable for use as such by a cataloger.  See the Manage Authorities interface
exposed through the Staff Client for that functionality.
