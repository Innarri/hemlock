Show Hold Patron Name in TPac
=============================

When looking up patron information for hold placement via the staff client in
TPac the hold patron name is now shown next to the entered barcode. In the event
that the barcode is not found a notice is displayed and the submit button is
disabled until a valid barcode is entered or the staff member is switched to.
