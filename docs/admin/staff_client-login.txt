Preset Tabs in Evergreen Client

To have preset tabs waiting when Evergreen opens you will need to modify the
*Evergreen shortcut* on your desktop.

. First, you need to copy your shortcut. There are a couple of ways to do this.

. Listed in the *Target* box you will see something like the following path
surrounded by quotation marks:   "C:\Program Files\Evergreen Staff Client MVLC\evergreen.exe"
+
image::media/shortcut_properties_window.png[]
+
. Place your cursor after the ending quotation mark. Enter a space after the
last quotation mark and then enter the tab code from the list below. Add
multiple tabs with a space separating them.

For Example, to have Checkout, Checkin, Catalog Search, and a blank tab preset:

. You may want to rename your shortcut to reflect its purpose. For example, you
could have one icon set to open circulation-related tabs and one icon to open
cataloging-related tabs. Right-mouse click and select *Rename* to do this.

Auto Login
~~~~~~~~~~~

To use auto login, you will need to modify the *Evergreen shortcut* on your desktop. There are three new commands which are necessary for automatic login:

- -ilsuser
- -ilspassword
- -ilshost

You will need all three to have your client successfully login. To enable
automatic login we need to modify the Evergreen shortcut on your desktop. If
your shortcut already has preset tab commands, then place the automatic login
commands after those commands. 

. First, if your workstation will have multiple logins (circ, cat, admin) you need to copy a shortcut for each. There are a couple of ways to do this.
.. Right-mouse click and drag icon; upon release select *Create Shortcut Here*. 
+
image::media/create_shortcut_here.png[]
+
.. Right-mouse click icon, select *Send to*, and select *Desktop (create shortcut)*.
+
image::media/send_to_desktop.png[]
+
. Right-mouse click the new shortcut and select *Properties*.
+
image::media/shortcut_properties.png[]
+
Listed in the *Target* box you will see something like the following path
surrounded by quotation marks: "C:\Program Files\Evergreen Staff Client MVLC\evergreen.exe"
+
image::media/shortcut_properties_window.png[]
+
. Place your cursor after the ending quotation mark and enter a space after the
last quotation mark.
+
image::media/target_box.png[]
+
.. After the space enter the login code for username followed by a space and
the username +
-ilsuser circuser
.. Enter a space and then the login code for password followed by the password +
-ilspassword circpass
.. Finally, enter the login code for host followed by a space and the host
address (this is the exact address which shows up in the Server Hostname box
when you manually login to the client. +
-ilshost evergreen.mvlcstaff.org
+
image::media/auto_login.png[]
+
[NOTE]
When you double-click on the new shortcut it may seem like nothing is
happening, but it really is! It takes the program a few moments to digest the
new requests and to do the login.

Logging Out
~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[staff client, logging out]

There are several ways to end your Evergreen staff client session:

* Click the *Exit Evergreen* button on the bottom of the login page.
* Click the *x* at the top left of the *login* window.
* Choose *File -> Quit Program* from the menu of the application window.

[CAUTION]

login window.
