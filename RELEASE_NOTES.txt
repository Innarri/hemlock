Evergreen Android App Release Notes
===================================

2013-10-27 Development APK
--------------------------
Major Fixes:
* Hold status.  Previously status was reported incorrectly.  Instead of
  "Waiting for copy" the app displayed "Transit".  Now hold details view
  is correct, and also indicates the number of total holds, number of
  total copies, and queue position.
* Hold update.  Removed email checkbox and phone number text box.  On C/W
  MARS site you can't update phone/email on holds, and it makes less sense
  on an app with limited screen real estate.

Minor Fixes:
* Enable moving the app to the SD card.  Requires minSdkVersion="8"
  (Android 2.2) but that reaches 95% of the market.
* Titles are consistently Title Case.
* Don't leak password to android log.
