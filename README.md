What is Hemlock?
----------------
Hemlock is an Android app for your library, provided your library is powered by [Evergreen](http://evergreen-ils.org/).

With the Hemlock app, you can:
* search the catalog
* place a hold
* review the items you have checked out
* renew items

Quick start for end users
-------------------------
1. Make sure your library catalog is powered by Evergreen.  Open the catalog in your browser, search for "Harry Potter", and scroll to the bottom.  If you see "powered by Evergreen", you are in luck!
2. Install the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kenstir.apps.hemlock)

Quick start for developers
--------------------------
1. This app is built with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).  Open the project under hemlock_app.
2. It might be nice to allow Hemlock to be built with Gradle or Android Studio.  If you want to do it, let me know and submit a pull request.
