What is Hemlock?
----------------
Hemlock is an Android app for your library, provided your library is powered by [Evergreen](http://evergreen-ils.org/).

With the Hemlock app, you can:
* search the catalog
* place a hold
* review the items you have checked out
* renew items

Quick start for end users
-------------------------
1. Make sure your library catalog is powered by Evergreen.  Open the catalog in your browser, search for "Harry Potter", and scroll to the bottom.  If you see "powered by Evergreen", you are in luck!
2. Install the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kenstir.apps.hemlock)

Quick start for developers
--------------------------
1. This app is built with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).  Open the project under hemlock_app.
2. Want to build Hemlock with Gradle or Android Studio?  If you want to do it, let me know and submit a pull request.

History of this app
-------------------
Large portions of this app were originally implemented by [Daniel Rizea](https://github.com/danielrizea) as a Google Summer of Code project.  It was never released through the Play Store.  For a long while the code sat in a [forgotten corner of the Evergreen Git repo](http://git.evergreen-ils.org/?p=working/Evergreen.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/collab/drizea/android), where it remained powerful but inactive, until one day it infected a hapless bystander, who worked on it [in the shadows](http://git.evergreen-ils.org/?p=working/Evergreen.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/user/kenstir/android-master) before releasing it to the world on this very site.
