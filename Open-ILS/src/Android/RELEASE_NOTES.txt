Evergreen Android App Release Notes
===================================

2013-12-04 Development APK
--------------------------
Major Fixes:
* Fixed crashes and blank activities caused by auth token expiration.
* Fixed crash in Preferences when selecting "days before expiration".
  Notifications not working, but at least not crashing.

2013-11-26 Development APK
--------------------------
Major Fixes:
* Fixed a major sources of crashes: non-main activities being created by
  Android when the app was not initialized.  This can happen for many
  reasons, and the cleanest fix I know is to restart at the
  SplashActivity.
* Switched from username/password stored in the preferences XML to
  accounts stored with the Android account manager.  This simplifies the
  handling of multiple accounts, account credentials, and auth tokens.
  The UI needs work but the mechanics appear sound.

2013-10-27 Development APK
--------------------------
Major Fixes:
* Hold status.  Previously status was reported incorrectly.  Instead of
  "Waiting for copy" the app displayed "Transit".  Now hold details view
  is correct, and also indicates the number of total holds, number of
  total copies, and queue position.
* Hold update.  Removed email checkbox and phone number text box.  On C/W
  MARS site you can't update phone/email on holds, and it makes less sense
  on an app with limited screen real estate.

Minor Fixes:
* Enable moving the app to the SD card.  Requires minSdkVersion="8"
  (Android 2.2) but that reaches 95% of the market.
* Titles are consistently Title Case.
* Don't leak password to android log.
