## Reason for Collection

The app collects general data on which features are used and how
often.  For example, if you place a hold, an event is collected noting
whether you chose email and/or SMS notification.  In the event of a
crash, a stack trace is collected, along with the make and model of the 
device, and some logs about the network requests made leading up to the crash.

This information allows us to fix bugs, and to improve and prioritize features.


## Personal Data Collected

- Installation UUID
- IP addresses - once received it is geo-coded to a city and displayed on a map for 10 seconds. Retained temporarily.
